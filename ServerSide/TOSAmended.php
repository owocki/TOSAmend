Hello,

The visitor at $ip has submitted a form at $url , in which they have used TOSAmend to reject the standard terms of service and counter-offered their own terms.  The terms of their counter-offer are:

'I reject the proposed terms and conditions and counteroffer that the standard consumer protection terms will apply.'

To accept the visitor's counter-offer, you do not need to take any action.  If you wish to reject or otherwise act upon their counter-offer, you may contact them directly.
