# TOSAmend

This is the initial README for the TOSAmend project.     The manifesto of the project can be found at http://owocki.com/2011/09/02/tosamend-the-easy-way-to-modify-web-service-terms-of-service-agreements/

## Product Roadmap / Ideas

1. Allow users to strikeout any clause in a TOS.  Pass struck out text to server for acceptance / reject
1. Do a lookup of the administrative contact of the website.  Pass amended TOS via email 
1. Track usage / amended TOS statistics on a backend server.

##TODO

1. Attain counsel for the project.  We need to know what exactly we need to be passing for the server such that " A reasonable person looking at the objective evidence (a rough approximation of the legal standard) would probably conclude that the company had agreed to your terms.
